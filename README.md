# Flutter google map.

I've been working on Google map
- Maps as widget
- Drawing polygons
- User location (updated)
- Online / Offline
- Marker path route
- Draw a route, along an existing road, between two points

## Getting Started

setup: add your GOOGLE API KEY inside Manifest.xml and All Pages

i developed a Mobile - App for Android that supports creating (CRUD) one or many geofences (polygons) and place/remove geo markers on the same Map. The app should prevent and warn the end-user if two or more polygons are overlapping or if he's trying to add a marker outside the defined polygons. If the App is closed and reopened the end-user should find all the polygons and markers previously defined before the app was closed.
